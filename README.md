# Playground  
Just a monorepo for stuff im trying out, and as a learning tool for new snake wranglers.  

## perft-generator  
its job is to have a functioning make move implementation that is in rust so that people have something to port over to other languages.  
It has perft results for a variety of positions that you can also run against your snake.  
for more info as to what the test_jsons themselves *actually* test, refer to [this file](tests.md)
